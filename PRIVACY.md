**Privacy Policy**

C. Liam Brown built the Easy Noise app as a Free Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by C. Liam Brown at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information of anyone who decides to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the description of the Service defined in this policy.

**Information Collection**

The app does not collect, store, or transmit any Personal Information of any kind.

The app does not use any third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

The app needs the "Phone" permission ("Allow Easy Noise to make and manage phone calls?") only to be able to pause playback during phone calls. It does not record, store, or transmit any information about the user's phone calls or other activity.

**Source Code**

The app's source code may be seen in its entirety on GitHub:
